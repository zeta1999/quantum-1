# quantum
Some software related to quantum computing and quantum information.

## Projects

* **[PAC-learning quantum states](pac_learning_quantum_states/)**. _This project demonstrates that the training set required to PAC-learn a quantum state scales linearly with the number of qubits. Proven by [Aaronson](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2007.0113)._
Written in Python.

* **[Quantum-inspired classical recommendation system](qrecc).** _This project implements the data structures and algorithm from [A quantum-inspired classical algorithm for recommendation systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04271.pdf) by Ewin Tang._ Written in Scala.
